title: About

This is a personal blog containing my musings on a variety of topics.

I exist â€” precariously attained relevance in an intensely mobile flux of past, present, and future.

Problem solver. Geek. Ideaveloper. Code artist. Storyteller. Believer in automation. Lover of games and the creative process. Font of useless (sometimes useful) knowledge. Idles poorly.
