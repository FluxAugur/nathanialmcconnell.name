> I must not fear.
> Fear is the mind-killer.
> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
> I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
> And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
> Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing.
> Only I will remain.
>
> - Frank Herbert, Dune
